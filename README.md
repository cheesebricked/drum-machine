# drum-machine
A drum machine made with pygame. 
I do not claim to own any audio assets used in this project.
Currently figuring out how to render this to an EXE

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Click boxes on screen to change the state to active.
  - There is 1 row for each instrument, and 16 beats per instrument. The pattern is in 16th notes.
- BPM counter is at the bottom left.
  - Use the scroll wheel to change the bpm
- Save files are in the bottom right.
  - Left-click to save a pattern
  - Right-click to load a pattern
 
FUTURE FEATURES:
- Save to .json file (coming very soon)
- Save and load indicators on screen
- "Are you sure you want to save/load?" popup when saving loading
